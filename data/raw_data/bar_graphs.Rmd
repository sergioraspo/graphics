```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gcookbook)
```


```{r}
BOD
```

## geom_col()
To create a bargraphs you can choose between two function: geom_bar() and geom_col(). The last one, always need the y values to create a plot.
```{r}
ggplot(BOD, aes(x = Time, y = demand)) +
  geom_col()
```

In this graphics one column is missing. So what can we do? treat the x value like discrete variable, using factor. Here in the next chunk
```{r}
ggplot(BOD, aes(x = factor(Time), y = demand)) +
  geom_col()
```

What change in this graphics, there is no gap between x values.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
